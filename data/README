All data downloaded from the original sources ("raw data") should be
stored here. Processed data files should be stored in the "output"
directory. Large data files should not be commited to the git
repository. If small data files are committed, make sure that data
usage conditions are being correctly followed (e.g., sometimes data
files cannot be made publicly available).
