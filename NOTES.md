# Instructor notes

## Post-workshop notes

+ I should not use the "data.table" package because many people found
  it difficult to install.

+ There were many issues with downloading the data and moving the
  files to the right location. Maybe I need to simplify the steps for
  downloading the data (e.g., by providing a single ZIP file
  containing all the data files).

+ Make the part about creating a new text file (e.g., divvyanalysis.R)
  optional, but recommended.

+ Toward beginning, add slide on selecting rows and columns of a data
  frame. This is a point I did not make clear.

## Instructor in-class setup

+ Arrange chairs and tables.
+ Clean up Desktop and quit applications (particularly Slack).
+ Use Terminal (not iTerm).
+ Use Basic Terminal theme.
+ Use Consolas font.
+ Fix bash prompt.
+ Arrange slides PDF and terminal on screen.
+ Distribute Yubikeys.
