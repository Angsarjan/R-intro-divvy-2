Materials for RCC workshop, "Introduction to R for data analysis",
May. 1, 2â€“4:30p.

## Introduction

The [R computing environment][R] has become one of the most important
tools in quantitative research, from computational biology to
financial modeling. This short workshop will expose participants to
the basic elements of R through an analysis of
[Divvy bike trip data][divvy-data]. No previous programming experience
is required. The aim is to provide participants with the basic tools
to explore the features of R or [RStudio][rstudio] on their own,
either on the [RCC cluster][RCC], or on their own computer. This is an
*introductory* level workshop, for users with little or no experience
in the topic.

## Prerequisites

All participants are expected to bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or
Windows operating system that they have administrative privileges
on. An RCC account is helpful, but not required.

## Other information

+ This workshop attempts to apply elements of the
[Software Carpentry approach][swc].

slides.pdf` in the [docs](docs) directory. For this to work, you will
need to to install the [rmarkdown][rmarkdown] package in R, as well as
the packages used in [slides.Rmd](code/slides.Rmd). For more details,
